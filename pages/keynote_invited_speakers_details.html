          <strong>TALK: </strong> From GPS, Google Maps & Uber to Spatial Computing
          <br/><br/>
          <strong>ABSTRACT: </strong> Spatial computing and spatial big data have already enriched billions of lives via pervasive services (e.g., navigation and ride-sharing apps), ubiquitous systems (e.g., geographical information system, spatial database management system), and pioneering scientific methods (e.g., spatial statistics). With 2 billion receivers in use for location and time services, the GPS has become a critical infrastructure for the world economy for use cases ranging from precision agriculture to navigation to ride sharing to smart cities. Government and industry have recently started major initiatives such as NASA Earth Exchange, Amazon Earth on AWS, Google Earth Engine, Microsoft AI for Earth, and NSF Navigating the New Arctic for meeting grand challenges facing our changing planet such as climate change and environmental sustainability. However, many spatial data science questions need to be probed to realize the transformative potential. For example, how may modern economy survive wide-spread GPS-jamming (or spoofing)? How may one continuously monitor our changing planet at high spatial resolution even during nights? How may spatial big data (e.g., smart-phone trajectories) be mined without violating privacy ? How may machine learning methods be generalized to address spatial challenges (e.g., auto-correlation, multi-scale, modifiable areal unit problem such as Gerrymandering)? How may we address spatial bias in data even when social feedback loops increase it? How may algorithms scale up to spatial big data to learn unbiased models? How may we leverage vehicle big data (e.g., on-board diagnostics with high spatio-temporal resolution) for eco-routing to model edge dependence of energy-use and emissions? This presentation shares a perspective on the societal accomplishments, opportunities, and research needs in spatial computing, spatial big data and spatial data science.

        <strong>TALK: </strong> Enterprise on Blockchain, let you big data sing
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>ABSTRACT: </strong> 
		This keynote gives an overview of 3 core components of Big data analytics,
		namely frontier AI enabled structured, semi and unstructured big data screening, reasoning
		and predictive analytics, known as applications; heterogenous data source integration
		known as backend or clouds; and data representation, visualisation and user interaction
		known as front-end. There is a world-wide effort for solution development on how to
		utilization of Blockchain for back-end enterprise databases modernization including
		distributed trust, single south of truth, transparency, immutability, traceability and
		anonymity etc. In addition, how to produce low-cost yet high dynamic systems that utilise
		variety of open source AI components for data intelligence and how to move the UX to
		mobile enabled platforms rather than back-office. To date, there has been no ready used
		solutions for large corporate and enterprises. <br> <br>
		This talk presents two real world project experiences and the issues and challenges facing to
		the adoption of the disruptive technology like Blockchain in the large corporate or private
		enterprises, where 1000-10,000 + legacy system co-exists and how blockchain can be
		integrated in such a complex and continue evolving environment. Particularly we present
		our patented work on Blockchain enabled big data analytics, data migration, data lake,
		combined with AI and open source technologies.<br> <br>
		This keynote also presents the technical issues of Blockchain including Blockchain
		ecosystems with legacy ERPs, real time performance of Blockchain, data lake on Blockchain,
		data integration and analytics between multi-Blockchains, private keys and certificates for
		multi-channel private Blockchains, and limitations of standards and policy. We provide
		possible solutions including Blockchain configuration, plug n play Blockchain, enterprise
		private and public Blockchains, network of partners, speed, space and security, building
		trusted data sources for visibility, transparency, immutability, accountability, and
		enablement of productivity, efficiency and effectiveness.

        <strong>TALK: </strong> Deep Learning Models for Medical Image Analysis: Challenges and Future Directions
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>ABSTRACT: </strong> 
        
          Medical imaging modalities such as X-rays, CT scan, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) exist to measure physical property of the human body. These modalities have raised the capabilities of clinicians by providing visualization of the internal details of human body with no or minimal invasion and has thus reduced the surgical procedures. However, manual analysis of these medical images is challenging due to several reasons such as extensive medical data, the bias involved in subjective assessment by clinicians, presence of the fine details that ordinarily cannot be observed through visual inspection. Machine learning methods have been employed to analyse medical images, which supports the clinician in the diagnosis of peculiar diseases that are difficult to identify otherwise. Recently, deep learning method is proposed which has the capability to learn or extract high-level, complex abstractions to represent samples through a hierarchical learning process from training samples. The power of deep learning lies in its capacity to analyse and learn patterns from large volume of data in unsupervised manner, which can be a valuable tool for Big Data Analytics where most of the available raw data is largely unlabeled and uncategorized. Additionally, the availability of GPU allows us to analyse unprecedented amounts of data. In my talk, I will discuss state of the art deep learning models for medical image segmentation and classification for a wide variety of health application areas. Finally, the talk will also focus on current challenges and future research directions for medical image analysis.

          <strong>TALK: </strong> Turning Sensing Data into Smart Data for Smart Sustainable Cities
          <br/><br/>
          <strong>ABSTRACT: </strong> 
          With recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), a wide variety of sensing data are disseminated, shared and utilized in smart cities to improve their efficiency and quality of life of citizens. The key is to turn sensing data into actionable information called “smart data”, used for planning, monitoring, navigation and intelligent decision making. In order to manipulate smart data, advanced data analytics is indispensable for detecting valuable events from sensing data and discovering and predicting latent associations among different kind of events. Their optimization in collaboration between a variety of observation data and application-specific data collected from users is also a crucial. In NICT Real World Information Analytics Project, an ICT platform called xData (cross-data) platform is constructed for developing smart applications with harnessing the above technologies toward realization of smart sustainable cities. For example, association discovery from a variety of meteorological and traffic data is performed to create and distribute a map that predicts various transport disturbance risks due to heavy rain, heavy snow and other abnormal weather conditions and to navigate safe, risk-free routes. The purpose of this talk is to introduce and discuss the latest challenges of novel methods and practices on smart data analytics and utilization.

          <strong>TALK: </strong> Interactive Web-Based Geospatial Big-Data Analytics for Vegetation Monitoring
          <br/><br/>
          <strong>ABSTRACT: </strong> 
          Monitoring of vegetation health has important applications in the areas of agriculture, climate change and biodiversity conservation. Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in monitoring vegetation health and assessment of physical conditions that may impact the health of vegetation. Ever increasing availability of datasets with high temporal and spatial resolution and ever-growing size of historical long-term datasets presents an opportunity for deriving critical insights for improving agricultural productivity, planning targeted biodiversity conservation programs and accurately assessing climate change impact. However, handling and analysing such huge volume and variety of data is challenging and requires specialized expertise and hardware/software infrastructure. In this paper, we present an interactive analysis system which is delivered as a web-application, for interactively analysing large multi-temporal datasets for vegetation monitoring applications. This system is openly accessible and requires only a web-browser on the part of the user. We discuss key aspects for backend design and implementation that enable very low latency interactive processing and present several useful applications of the system.

          <strong>TALK: </strong> Segment-search vs Knowledge Graphs: Making a Key-word Search Engine for Web Documents
          <br/><br/>
          <strong>ABSTRACT: </strong> 
          It is becoming increasingly popular to publish data on the web in
the form of documents. Segment-search is a semantic search
engine for web documents. It presents a query language. It is
suitable for skilled and semi-skilled domain experts, who are
adept at the use of a specific collection of documents. It returns
suitable documents selected by using document fragments, that
satisfy user’s query. In contrast to knowledge graph approach,
the technique is based on performing web page segmentation as
per user perceived objects. Thus, it allows users’ to query without
the knowledge of complex query languages or learning about the
data organization schemes. The proposed system is scalable and
can cater to large scale web document sources.

          <strong>TALK: </strong> The potential of Big Data Analytics in making sense of Urban Heat Island and Air Quality Monitoring data
          <br/><br/>
          <strong>ABSTRACT: </strong> 
          Deteriorating ambient air quality and increasing surface and near-surface air temperatures are worsening problems in urban areas. While ambient air quality (AAQ) is understood in absolute terms, as the suspended pollutant load in the breathable zone, surface and near-surface air temperatures are most commonly talked about in relative terms – as the difference in temperature between “urban” and “rural” areas, the so-called urban heat island (UHI) effect.
          <br/>
          Historically, AAQ and UHI have been studied as separate issues by climate scientists and geographers, respectively. Both are major urban environmental issues and of prime importance for urban planning, but have not been on the radar screen of urban planners, city engineers, and policy makers. This is largely due to the lack of good empirical data and models which could be used in the planning process. Ambient air quality and near-surface air temperatures are intricately linked and are both influenced by the form of the built-up area and the functioning of the population using those areas. In other words, both UHI and AAQ are influenced by various characteristics of the urban morphology. These characteristics include the shape, size and layout of the physical infrastructure, the form, and the population density, layout of streets, available modes of transport, land use and land cover, and spatial growth patterns, the function.
          <br/>
          The purpose of this presentation is not to talk about an application of big data analytics (BDA) to modeling air quality or urban heat stress. But to look at AAQ and UHI data collected by the authors and their collaborators, and ask the question: How can we use the techniques of BDA to integrate large volumes of heterogeneous data and discover the linkages among a host of physical and economic, cultural and social parameters to extract the underlying patterns?
          <br/>
          Until recently, remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) was the only reliable source for studying the UHI phenomena. Satellite technology provides spatially continuous observations of LST over large areas, but the urban configurations of large cities in India vary spatially and functionally, and given their rapid spatial growth and increasing population density, it has been difficult to understand and link the UHI to various urban morphology characteristics. Similarly, the concentration of particulate matter in air is affected by a large number of interlinked factors: the urban morphology, the local and regional land use patterns, and climate factors such as temperature, humidity, sunlight, and air movement. Modelling and understanding the contributions of these factors to air quality has not seen much success as it has been difficult to extract patterns from the available data which is both sparse, in terms of spatial coverage, and too much, in terms of sheer volume.
          <br/>
          Data scarcity is no longer an issue. With inexpensive, ground-based, static and mobile sensors and automated systems for recording data from them becoming ubiquitous, we are now drowning in a sea of data riches. A determined researcher can access terabytes of data from their desk. But, ironically, this has made modelling even more difficult due to the sheer volume and heterogeneity of data. This is where the role of big data analytics comes in.<br><br>
