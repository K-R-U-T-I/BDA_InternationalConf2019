    <br/>
    <h4>
    <b>Speakers: <a href="#">Anush Sankaran and Hima Patel (IBM Research – India)</a><br/><br/>
    Duration: 3 hrs</b> <br/><br/>
	  </h4>
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    It is well understood in the literature that the performance of an AI model is upper bounded
    by the quality of the data. While researchers and practitioners have focused on improving
    the quality of the model (such as neural architecture search and automated feature
    selection), there is limited amount of efforts towards improving the data quality. To
    overcome this challenge, we propose the “Data for AI” - a research agenda around data
    understanding, data quality measurement, data cleaning and preparation, and making it
    ready for the corresponding upstream AI application.<br>
    The aim of this tutorial is to talk about tools and techniques to make data ready for an AI
    application. We will discuss different dimensions along which the quality of data for AI can
    be measured such as: Data Trust, Data Richness, Data Labels and Data Cleanliness.
    Specifically, we will deep dive into three specific issues in terms of data quality:<br><br>
    <b>• Data Richness:</b> 
    This problem encompasses the fundamental question of whether “Is the
    given data is rich enough to perform analytics or classification using an AI model?”. In plenty
    of industry settings, this is the problem that is being addressed by domain experts and data
    scientists. Here, we aim to automatically analyze and provide a score and explanation for a
    provided dataset, based on its richness value, even before the data science lifecycle starts.
    This can allow a data scientist to either ask for additional data or trim unnecessary data.<br>
    <br>
    <b>• Noisy Data Labels:</b> 
    In many largescale classification problems, labelled data is often
    obtained through crowd sourcing or by automatically using information on the web. These
    systems are prone to human labelling errors, measurement errors and subjective biases of
    labelers. We discuss about methods for detection and cleaning of label noise present in the
    data.<br><br>
    <b>• AutoLabeling of Documents:</b> 
    Most of the data that we collect or gather through sensors/
    internet are unlabeled. With minimal SME effort, we can get a few samples of them
    labelled. “How to label the rest of the large volume of unlabelled data?”. The aim of this
    research work is to automatically tag and extract keywords from documents scraped
    through web, so that the documents could be intelligently indexed. The enhanced indexing
    provides better results for any kind of upstream search and retrieve applications as well as
    question answering applications.<br><br>
    <br/>

    <h4>
    <b>Speakers: <a href="mailto:sharma@cse.uta.edu">Sharma Chakravarthy (Univ of Texas, Arlington) </a><br/><br/>
    Duration: 3 hrs</b> <br/><br/>
	  </h4>
    <b>Abstract:</b>
	In this tutorial, we argue that graph analysis techniques are extremely important and is
	receiving renewed attention as the data sets are becoming complex and their sizes are
	increasing. There is also renewed interest in answering graph queries in both exact and
	approximate way due to the presence of large graph based such as FreeBase and entity-
	based very large graphs. Although aggregate analysis techniques (such as communities,
	hubs, subgraphs, etc.) exist for single and simple graphs, extending them to attribute graphs
	is not easy. As an alternative, multilayer Networks (or MLNs) are being explored and new
	analysis approaches are being developed. <br/><br/>
	In this tutorial, we start with single graph analysis, establish their limitations for complex
	data sets analysis and introduce MLNs. We will discuss the notions of communities and hubs
	and their relevance to aggregate analysis. We will discuss extending these notions to
	multilayer networks, challenges, and current approaches and solutions. We will apply the
	techniques discussed to a number of case studies to appreciate their need, utility,
	applicability, efficiency, and scalability.

    <b>Abstract:</b>
Healthcare industry across the world has progressed very rapidly over last two decades. It is
likely to rise 5.4% annually to just over $10 trillion. The newer research and innovations in
medical domain have helped increasing the life expectancy in men from 51 to 66 years and
from 55 to 71 in women in last three decades. However, the healthcare industry is behind
other sectors in adopting the newer IT technologies. This tutorial focuses on imbibing the
latest technologies, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain, with medical
domain innovations.<br/><br/>
Blockchain has emerged from a conventional crypto world to a business world with many
emerging solutions in Healthcare domain. The Blockchain represents the immutable and
append only database that is written post consensus from each party who is participant in
the network. The primary scope of Blockchain in this proposal will focus on storing
electronic medical records securely over the Blockchain and using the date for auto claim
settlements, medical research and providing support to AI engines to quick and better
diagnosis.<br/><br/>
Healthcare using AI is amongst the fastest growing research area across the globe. AI along
with big data can improve and reduce the cost of healthcare. A massive amount of
heterogeneous data generated in healthcare sector offers opportunities for big data
analytics. Such analysis transforms big data into real and actionable insights to healthcare
practices, thus provide new understanding and ways for better and quicker treatment. Due
to increasing availability of electronic healthcare data (structured as well as unstructured
data) and rapid progress of analytics techniques, a lot of research is being carried out in this
area.<br/><br/>
The first session of tutorial focuses on advent of blockchain in healthcare. In this session, we
will discuss some practical applications of blockchain technology in record sharing, auto
claim settlements, incentivizing patients and providing authentic information to the
research organizations. During the second session of tutorial, we shall discuss the
significance of artificial intelligence for healthcare sector. Next, we will demonstrate two AI-
powered healthcare applications. The discussion of each application will include precise
problem statement, proposed solution, data collected &amp; used, experimental analysis and
challenges faced to achieve this success. Finally, we will discuss why do we need
explanations, what are the explanations and what is the future of Explainable AI (XAI) in
healthcare.

    <b>Abstract:</b>
Knowledge Graphs (KG) are graph structures that capture knowledge in the form of entities,
relationships between them, and additional information including provenance and context
of relation-ships. They are now extensively used by several enterprises across many
different domains such as the Web, e-commerce, healthcare, geoscience, manufacturing,
aviation, power, oil and gas. Private KGs are used by commercial enterprises such as Google,
Microsoft,Yahoo, LinkedIn, Amazon, eBay, GE, etc., and on the other hand, DBpedia,
Wikidata, YAGO, NELL etc., are available publicly. Semantic Web technologies such as RDF
(Resource Description Framework),and OWL (Web Ontology Language), which are also W3C
standards, play a crucial role in the representation of KGs. In this introductory tutorial on
KGs, we will discuss RDF and how they are used to represent a KG, how one can store and
operate over knowledge graphs at scale, and finally present a few important applications
of knowledge graphs including their uses in information retrieval and NLP for entity linking,
entity retrieval, question answering, and conversational systems.

    <b>Abstract:</b>
In this tutorial, we describe various information extraction techniques in data constrained
environments. We focus on extracting information from emails, specifically business-to-
consumer (B2C) emails (e.g., order confirmations, flight reservations, etc.). Unlike web
pages, emails are personal and due to privacy and legal considerations, no other human
except the receiver can view them. Thus, adapting extraction techniques used for web
pages, such as HTML wrapper-based techniques, have privacy and scalability challenges. We
describe end-to-end information extraction system for emails—data collection,
anonymization, classification, building information extraction models, deployment, and
monitoring. We particularly focus on various extraction algorithms which either require just
a small set of donated (original) emails or work well with (larger) anonymized data. Besides
describing efficient anonymization techniques, we also describe several machine learning
techniques where different textual and visual features from emails are used. We conclude
the tutorial by outlining open research problems in data-constrained information extraction.
